// Package lane provides a context-aware logging and correlation library.
//
// A "lane" is a context that integrates logging, combining Go's `log` package with its `context`.
// A lane is designed to be passed into all functions, serving as a regular `context` for tasks like cancellation,
// while also replacing `log` for logging purposes.
//
// The logging interface offers various tools for detailed diagnostics, including correlation IDs, stack traces,
// easy logging of structs (even private fields), log capturing for test verification, recording structural
// differences, and more.
